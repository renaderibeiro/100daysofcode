# 100DaysofCode
The 100 days of Code is a challenge to code or study at least one hour everyday for the next 100 days.
My motivation for this challenge is **to improve my abilities in Web Developmnent** in general.
This challenge is being fulfilled by **[Renata Ribeiro](https://github.com/renaderibeiro)**.
The daily progress is being written in my Twitter's account **[@renacoder](https://twitter.com/renacoder)**.

### Two Main Rules
1. Code/Study minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
